# HOBS Companion — Full History (reconstructed from the chats)

A dated timeline of everything that happened on the HOBS Companion app: what was built or
changed, where, why, the bugs created, fixed and recurring, and the decisions (including what
was rejected and why).

**How this was made**: reconstructed Sept 29, 2026 onward from Akash's complete claude.ai chat
export, read in strict time order across all app chats (see `docs/HISTORY_PROGRESS.md` for
scope and method). Nothing here is from memory or guesswork: each entry comes from the chats,
tagged with the chat it came from. Where the chats don't say something, the entry says so.

**Exact code** for any edit mentioned here is in `docs/history/code/<YYYY-MM>.md`, found by its
`E-...` id. Git-era changes (Sept 22, 2026 onward) also have exact diffs in `docs/CHANGE_LOG.md`.

**Chat labels**: C11 Learning from previous mistakes · C16 Claude on multiple devices ·
C17 Obsidian/token usage · C21 Offline agent · C22 Converting website to app · C23 App part 2 ·
C26 App continuation · C28 App 3 · C31 App part 4.

**Status**: in progress. See `docs/HISTORY_PROGRESS.md` for how far the reading has got.

## Timeline

(Entries are appended below in time order as each chunk is read.)

### June 2026 — before the app: the memory problem shows up first (on the website work)

These three chats are about how Claude works with Akash, not about the app. They matter
because the same continuity problem later hits the app, and the fixes tried here set the
pattern the app sessions followed.

- **Jun 18 (C16)** — Akash asks about running two Pro accounts on phone and laptop. Learned:
  skills/connectors are per account; he can't keep switching accounts on mobile.
- **Jun 21 (C17)** — Akash asks for "a second brain that never forgets" to save tokens.
  Claude proposes Obsidian (local notes) connected via Claude Desktop, and builds a
  "Claude Context" vault: master brief, brand, website, SEO, programs, decisions log,
  session log (E-019eebde-4 … -20). Akash asks what happens if a file is wrong; Claude
  admits the first version was written **from memory** and flags guesses. Akash orders a
  full cross-check against all past chats. The rebuilt version (E-019eebe6-32 … -48) found
  real errors in the from-memory version — e.g. a website REST endpoint listed as active
  when it had been deleted, cache settings listed as ON when they were OFF, a focus keyword
  wrongly overwritten once before.
  **Lesson recorded then, and repeated since**: anything written from memory must be
  checked against the source before it's trusted.
- **Jun 22 (C17)** — Obsidian setup fails in practice (Claude misreads Akash's screenshots
  three times — first calls Obsidian "Claude Desktop", then points to icons that aren't
  there). Switched to **Google Drive** as the second brain, since the Drive connector was
  already set up and Claude can read/write it directly.
- **Jun 24–26 (C17)** — Akash's real complaint: sessions end too fast and tokens go unused.
  Claude's answer: the notes don't lengthen sessions, they make restarting cheap; work in
  one-task sessions; write a session log before a session dies; consider Max.
- **Jun 27 (C21)** — Akash asks how to build an agent that keeps working while he's offline.
  Claude proposes: GitHub Actions on a schedule + a task list file in a repo + the Anthropic
  API + credentials stored as GitHub Actions secrets. Nothing was built. (This is the same
  idea proposed again on Sept 29 — it was first raised here, three months earlier.)
- Found while reading: a WordPress REST token appears in plain text in C17/C21 (reported
  disabled in June). Redacted in these docs. If that endpoint was ever re-enabled with the
  same token, it should be rotated.

### July 3, 2026 — the app is scoped (C22 "Converting website to app")

- **13:34 UTC** — Akash asks if the website can become an app. Claude suggests a PWA (installable
  website). Within three messages Akash says it needs "a lot of additional functionalities and
  change a lot of structure", so from here on it is scoped as **its own product, not a copy of
  the website**.
- **Features Akash asked for, day one**: regular notifications and reminders, free testing,
  mood tracker, appointment booking, events, payment (via QR), task help "like Clarify for
  ADHD", and a design that is **sensory-pleasing and neurodivergent-affirmative**. Then added:
  an **SOS button** that sends live location to chosen people on WhatsApp (like Zomato), and
  **chatrooms**. Then an in-app shop with its own wallet.
- **Decisions and rejections that day:**
  - Built first: **mood tracker + task scheduler** (Akash's pick).
  - **Real-money wallet rejected**: needs an RBI prepaid-instrument licence. Replaced with a
    **points/credits system** (earn by engaging, redeem on HOBS services). Akash agreed.
  - **SOS auto-send rejected for now**: WhatsApp doesn't allow silent location broadcast
    without the paid Business API. Free version: SOS grabs GPS and opens pre-filled WhatsApp
    messages; the person taps send. Claude flagged that SOS needs a crisis protocol (who
    receives it, what they do), not just a button. (SOS is still an open item in Sept.)
  - Chatrooms: flagged that moderation (who watches for crisis language) is the hard part.
  - **Hard constraint set by Akash: "I don't want it to cost anything."** Everything planned
    on free tiers.
- A scoping document (`HOBS_App_Scoping_Document.docx`) was generated with the phased feature
  list, free-vs-paid paths, the rejected ideas, and open decisions (E-019f283e-7 is the script
  that built it).
- Claude's expanded suggestions: journaling prompts, small-wins log, breathing/grounding, focus
  timer with body doubling, Bob/Kunnu as in-app guides, a sensory profile at onboarding,
  anonymous community wall, crisis resources page, resource library, micro-lessons; and a
  sensory design system (soft chime, reduce-motion, muted/high-contrast mode, dyslexia font,
  gentle haptics, **no punishing streaks — a garden or jar that doesn't reset**). Claude noted
  custom notification sounds need a native app, not web push.
- **13:56** — Akash: "Yes (and you will be doing everything)." From here Claude is the sole
  builder.
- **14:00–16:52 UTC — more scope, then the key architecture decision:**
  - Added to scope: a curated **YouTube section** (hand-picked, themed, no autoplay), simple
    **sensory games** (no scores, no timers, no losing), and suggested: Gujarati/Hindi toggle,
    personal safety plan builder, anonymized institutional dashboard for SAMVEDNA, gentle
    mood trends, resource search. Claude flagged the list had reached ~25 items and pushed
    to lock scope and ship the mood tracker first.
  - Cost table given: everything ₹0 at ~500 users; only SOS auto-send (WhatsApp Business
    API) would cost money soon.
  - **Akash's corrections (16:41):** use **Google Calendar Appointment Schedule + Meet**
    instead of Cal.com; **SOS deferred** to a later phase; use better PWA options if any.
  - Akash asks whether **Fable 5** would do better (it was free on Pro until Jul 7). Claude:
    spend Fable on architecture and hard engineering, not on design iteration.
  - **16:50–16:52 — the decisive clarification from Akash:** "It doesn't have to be a copy
    paste of website", the website "doesn't follow a soothing sensory", "we don't have to
    follow wordpress at all… when I said convert website into app, I didn't mean it
    literally." → **Decision: a standalone app, not inside WordPress/Elementor.** Planned:
    free hosting (Vercel/Netlify/Firebase), Firebase or Supabase as the only backend, own
    PWA files, the website just links to it (later a subdomain — HOBS owns the domain).
  - Akash's rule on assets: **"if you need me to create assets, you tell me, and not just
    use any asset!"**
- **16:58** — Claude reads the mascot folder on Drive (Bob, Cookie, Po, Kunnu + room scenes:
  Screening Room, Community Center, Therapy Room, Body Doubling). Observations: storybook
  illustration style; the full portraits aren't UI-ready (no small expression states); room
  scenes could become the app's navigation ("visiting rooms in a home"). Asks whether
  simplified expression icons exist.
- **17:01** — Akash: the live screening-tests page on the website is the design reference;
  these are all the assets for now; and **don't touch the website** — look at the reference
  somewhere else.
- **17:03** — Claude tries to screenshot the live page via Claude in Chrome twice; it isn't
  connected in the app. Akash: "Do not waste tokens unnecessarily." (First recorded instance
  of a pattern Akash objects to repeatedly: retrying an approach that already failed.)
- **17:04–17:06 — what "the testing page is almost perfect" means:** Akash clarifies it's the
  **tests, scoring and results** that are right, not the look. Claude recovers the page's
  mechanics from past sessions: test picker → one block of questions at a time with a live
  counter → per-test scoring functions → colour-coded severity bands → results sent to
  HubSpot with a retry/localStorage fallback. **Decision: carry that logic over exactly; only
  the visual design changes.**
- **17:09–17:12** — first visual prototype (chat widget). Akash rejects it: wrong colours, not
  Bob's real image, and **"Everything we do has to be completely scientific and gold
  standard!"**
- **17:14–17:24 — the mood instrument decision (clinical):**
  - Akash wants the check-in to help therapists with diagnosis too.
  - Claude proposes I-PANAS-SF (10 items). Research: its licence is scoped to academic use and
    it lacks direct Indian validation; full PANAS (20 items) has Hindi/Indian validation but
    is too heavy for daily use.
  - Akash: be practical ("I don't think Thompson would even respond!"), must be **valid in the
    Indian context and not exhausting**; otherwise find another validated test.
  - **Decision: WHO-5 Well-Being Index**, weekly — free under CC BY-NC-SA, validated in India
    including a **Gujarati version**, 5 items, ~1 minute, positively worded, 0–100 score with
    cutoffs (≤50 poor wellbeing / follow-up, ≤28 likely depression). **Daily = a casual,
    non-clinical mood note; weekly = the real WHO-5.** Akash: "Yes, build it that way."
  - Claude's rule stated here: a 2-week-lookback instrument must not be given daily.
- **17:24–18:10 — the colour fight (many rounds):**
  - Brand colours (cream/navy/teal/gold) → rejected: be sensory-first, like **Clarify ADHD**.
  - Clarify-style muted pastels → rejected: "pastel isn't soothing… THINK EVERY POSSIBLE WAY
    TO OPTIMISE THE VISUALS!"
  - Research-based low-arousal palette (no red/orange, grey-green-blue, no patterns behind
    task screens; background images only on non-task screens) → Akash asks for real HOBS
    art as the background, and flags the 0–5 numbers weren't centred in their circles.
  - **Bug: embedded images don't render in the chat widget tool** — two attempts failed and
    took the buttons down with them before Claude tested it minimally (17:52) and confirmed
    the limitation. Fix: build a real HTML file instead (`hobs-prototype/index.html`,
    E-019f291c-4), verified by screenshot + pixel analysis before sending.
  - 18:02: "awfully dead and dull"; and **"Where can I see the actual version?"** Claude:
    nothing is deployed yet — all of this is design exploration, no database, no URL.
  - Claude conceded it over-applied "low arousal" as grey-beige; pushed back on going to
    red/orange/neon. Deeper pine/teal → "still not bright enough, and you gave shapes when
    we're supposed to use the image" → brighter teal/green with the real image more visible
    (E-019f2928-2) → 18:08 Akash: it should feel **warm and bright** so people want to use
    it. Claude: warmth from luminous golden light, not hot saturated hues (E-019f292b-2).
